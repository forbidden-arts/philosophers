## ü§ì Overview
Who Knew Philosophy Could be so Deadly?

As an aspiring philosopher, there is nothing I would like to do more than to spend all of my time eating, sleeping, and thinking when I'm not doing either of the prior activities.

This was the first adventure in multithreading, mutexes, and the joys of data races. [Here is a breakdown](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E60778_01/html/E60750/gepdy.html#scrolltoc) of how Oracle approached the problem, but it should be noted that they did it in a simplistic way that does not scale, nor is it portable. Basically, they side-stepped the issue by having half of the philosophers pause for a few milliseconds. Seems like cheating to me. Also, look at that IDE! What is that, Windows 7?

## üßê So What's the Deal?
- **`Each philosopher has a fork`** That's all they can afford.
- **`But, they need two forks to eat`** For maximum face-stuffing.
- **`So they use their neighbor's fork`** Because... hygiene?

Also, there cannot be data races (for non-nerds: you cannot be updating a value at the same time it's being read by another thread. In a real-life scenario this can be disasterous. Here, it's just mildly annoying).

## üì∑ Preview
Here is a visual representation of what the program does.

## üíª Compilation
To compile:

```make```

Remove the object files:

```make clean```

Remove everything:

```make fclean```

## ü§° Usage
The program takes the following arguments:

**`./philo [# of philos] [time to die] [time to eat] [time to sleep]`** and an optional *```[how many times to eat]```*

If you don't tell the philosophers to stop eating after N number of meals, they'll continue to gorge themselves in perpetuity.

`Just like I do.`

The program will take up to 250 philosophers, but you will notice that there will start to be some time-slippage that results from the computer hardware starting to fall behind when starting/pausing/evaluating threads. It's slow, but noticeable, and will eventually result in someone starving.

Unless your computer is at NASA or CERN, in which case you can disregard this warning.

### üìù License
My inner philosopher tells says that information wants out, so feel free to have copy/paste/starve philosophers to your heart's content.
